# Chess App

Building a chess app in React with a Scala backend.

## Intent

This project is for the following learning goals:

- Solidify my understanding of React and typescript.
- Learn to set up a backend API for loading/saving games.
  - I have not decided which language to use for the backend. Part of me
    wants to try using golang for the cool factor, but the other thinks I
    should stick to scala/play for familiarity's sake.
- Learn about chess AI algorithms.
