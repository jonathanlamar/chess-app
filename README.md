# Chess App

Building a chess app in React with a backend for saving games.

## Intent

This project is for the following learning goals:

- Solidify my understanding of React and typescript.
- Learn to set up a backend API in Scala for loading/saving games.
  - I could also do this in flask or Django or something. I haven't settled
    on a backend yet and don't need to implement it right away. The game
    logic will all be in the frontend.
- Learn about chess AI algorithms.
